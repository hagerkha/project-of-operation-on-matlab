The project in MATLAB involves processing two signals, performing operations on audio, adding noise, removing noise, and generating an ECG heart plot.

Here's a breakdown of the tasks involved:

Signal Processing:

Acquire two signals.
Preprocess the signals if necessary, such as filtering or normalization.
Audio Operations:

Add noise to one of the signals.
Remove noise from the noisy signal.
ECG Heart Plot:

Extract the ECG signal from one of the acquired signals.
Plot the ECG signal to visualize the heart's electrical activity.
